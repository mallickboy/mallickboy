# <b>Hey There, Code Enthusiasts</b>

Hey there! I'm mallickboy, a passionate coder and Computer Science and Engineering student. I thrive on tackling complex problems and experimenting with innovative coding solutions that positively impact the coding, civil, or economic sectors.

With a keen interest in both emerging technologies and time-tested principles, I enjoy diving into a wide range of projects—from cutting-edge deep learning models to practical desktop applications. My expertise spans various areas including Python, web development, blockchain, databases, machine learning, and multi-threading.

If you're looking for a friendly contributor for your private or open-source projects, I'm eager to collaborate and bring fresh perspectives to the table. Feel free to reach out!
